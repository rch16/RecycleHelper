# RecycleHelper
### A persuasive smartphone app for improving recycling performance

This repo documents the design and development of RecycleHelper, a persuasive smartphone app for improving recycling performance that was created as my Final Year Project for an MEng degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London.

The app provides resources to allow users find out how to recycle 100+ items, and currently provides specific information for the following locations:

* London Boroughs of Barnet, Ealing, Kensington and Chelsea, Newham and Westminster
* Leeds
* St Albans and Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire
* Cardiff and Penarth, Wales

And generic information for the rest of the UK. Persuasive techniques are employed to help motivate users to improve their recycling behaviour - for more information, please see the Final Report.
